## Reflections

An essential part of how I see my involvement in research and the use of tech is this constant reflection of the 'extractive' and many times 'exclusionary' methods and tools to carry out quantitative research. 
Being aware of terms like 'extacting data' and/or 'mining data' allows me as a researcher to not fall within a mentality of extraction and objectifying the humans whose data I am working with. Or so I'd love to think!

The mere nature of writing this programme made me reflect so much on the process of it, from beginning to end.
How the objetification of people's data ends up being that! Data... as an object in constant extraction by tech companies, governments, academia, etc.

Is there a way to make the collection of people's data fair/just? Should it even be a thing? 
Data - ultimately people's ideas, thoughts, reflections, anger, frustrations, happiness, visions...their everyday life gets reduced to extractable information.
How can anyone collecting data for any purpose, especially those of us that identify this "automatic" objectification in data extraction.
